# Probabilistic Planning for Demonstration Discovery

This folder contains code for reproducing the experiments in the paper *Learning from Demonstration without Demonstrations*, T. Blau, P. Morere, G. Francis, ICRA 2021.

The folder `garage` contains code for running the RL experiments in the garage framework. The folder `R3L_exploration` contains code for running the P2D2 algorithm in order to automatically discover demonstrations. See the readme files in the respective folders for further instructions.
